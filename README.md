Youtube remains strong and steady as a business platform, generating enormous revenue and views. 
According to Youtube’s annual financial report at 2023, YouTube generated $31.5 billion revenue in 2023, a 1.3% increase year-by-year. Over 2.7 billion people access YouTube at least once a month. 
Its premium membership reached 100 million subscribers in 2024. These ensuring numbers built confidence for us to dig deeper into business, spending our resources and guiding our content creators to success. 
It would be crucial to know where the pain point of the market is, so we can distribute our time and resources effectively, to maximize profitability and output. We are looking for trends from the Youtube market focused dataset. 

The data set studied is “Global Youtube Statistics 2023” posted on the website Kaggle. The set is updated annually on Kaggle based on data sourced from Social Blade. 
This data pool includes the number of video views and subscribers, channel category, ranking, annual earnings, and country of origin for each of the top 995 YouTube channels. 
The dataset enables the analysis of YouTube growth trends, category-based performance, demographic impact on viewership, and revenue potential for promoting our current and future content creators with success factors in the YouTube landscape.

The following questions created an outline to answer our problem statement: 
Which channels bring in and have the most growth in subscribers and views? 
Which video categories are the most popular? 
Which countries have the most viewed channels and the greatest amount of popular channels? 
Which channels, categories, and locations have the highest and lowest earnings? 
Do higher urban populations correlate with view and subscriber count?

The variables we analyzed to answer these questions are: Channels, Highest Yearly Earnings, Countries, Video Views, Subscribers, and Channel Categories.
      
From creating correlation matrices and visualizations between the highest yearly earnings against the other variables, we can identify which variables prompt the highest earnings. 
Utilizing maps to display which countries contain the most popular content creators, we can locate which markets should be prioritized.
